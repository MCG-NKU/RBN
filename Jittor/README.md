# Jittor Implementation of Representative Batch Normalization (RBN)


## Introduction
[Jittor](https://github.com/Jittor/Jittor) is a high-performance deep learning framework based on JIT compiling and meta-operators.
We give the code of RBN using Jittor. You can use the PyTorch pretrained models on Jittor and receive an instant inference acceleration. 


## Usage
Run `diff.py` to compared the inference performance between Pytorch and Jittor.
